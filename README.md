This is the repistory of Akintayo David Ademola, submitted as part of the requirements for the degree of M.Sc. Data Science at the School of Computing, Robert Gordon University, Scotland. The primary area of interest in this project is the data science sub-field known as artificial intelligence, or AI.
It comprises of a review, design, and experimentation of mathematical and computational procedures for training machines to accurately detect indicators of depressive disorders in social media usersâ€™ posts. This experimental report specifically follows what was examined and addressed in the investigation report
